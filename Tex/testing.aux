\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{More should be done in order to ensure that only users with unique usernames are allowed to register.}{9}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The system should ensure that users are not registered to the application if their given email address is already been used by another user. This is important since email addresses are used to sign into the application.}{9}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Since almost half of the registration tests failed, the awarded mark out of ten was reduced to five and a half. One mark was then subtracted from this mark since more feedback could have been given. \newline  }{9}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{The sign in can still be improved by giving the user more feedback when data is left blank.}{13}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Since the actual results of all of the test cases were the same as the expected results, the sign in should be awarded full marks. However, since the sign in can still be improved by giving the user more feedback when data is left blank, only 9/10 was awarded as there is still room for improvement.\newline  }{13}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Additional comments: \newline  A possible improvement could be to add an input field to the "Edit Profile" page for the user to change their password.}{14}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Since three of the five test cases actual results were not the same as the expected result, the awarded mark out of ten was initially four. Since one has to navigate to another page to change their password, another mark was deducted. \newline  }{14}}

This would lead to incorrect locations being saved, and could also affect the process of navigating from the users current location to another location. \newline  }{16}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Since the only test case failed, a mark of zero would be awarded however, the page is pleasing to look at which resulted in an additional two marks being added. \newline  }{16}}
